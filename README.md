## Usage

Have you ever wanted a digital cookbook that plays your own music playlist while you cook? Come and enjoy your own recipes and rhythms. We have created the app that will allow you to enjoy both! 

The user is immediately presented with a login page that authenticates who is logging with with a standard email and password combination. When the user first logs in, they will be immediately directed to add their first recipes. When they opt to create their first recipe, they will be asked for their ingredients and instructions to create the recipe. After the recipe is completed, they will be given the option to add more recipes or review the ones already created by clicking on the recipe names.

The recipes and ingredients are passed through respective models and will be applied to the user's login ID.

```
module.exports = function(sequelize, DataTypes) {
var Ingredients = sequelize.define("Ingredients", {
  title: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
    validate: {
      len: [1, 50]
    }
  },
  
  body: {
        type: DataTypes.TEXT,
        allowNull: false,
        len: [1, 255]
      }
});
Ingredients.associate = function(models) {
   
    Ingredients.belongsTo(models.Recipe, {
      foreignKey: {
        allowNull: false
      }
    });
  };
return Ingredients;
}

```

One API is intended to help design this page. Spotify is intended to give users a readily recognizable interface layout and use their already existing playlists, without having to go through the trouble of recreating new ones.

[AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) was used to allow the logo image to drop in on the home page of the site. all we had to do was add 'animate_animated animate_bounceInDown' to the class of the image.

## Future Development

In future developments of this webpage, the site will be tied to the Spotify API to let you choose the mood before you start cooking. The site will also allow you to search recipes from other uses, if they decide to make them public.
